                <p>Hello! I am Axlrose Guevarra, a traditional artist crafting emotion through the shadows of black and white. 
                    My work focuses on transforming simple ideas into expressive hand-drawn illustrations that feel sincere and 
                    impactful. I aim to inspire others through the stories my art conveys, sharing my skills and encouraging fellow 
                    artists to explore their own creativity. With every piece I create, I continue to grow, learn, and elevate my craft.

                <p>안녕! I’m Edwynne Raschieka H. Janda and I’m currently studying under the Bachelor of Multimedia Arts. 
                    My niche in art is digital art, but I can also work with other art forms. In every piece that I do, 
                    I often make them with love and care—treating each of them as a part of my own. I also love working at my own pace and 
                    letting the story of my works unfold slowly with time. 
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: #1E424D;">Graphic Design</h4>
                <p>Hi! I’m Dyan Alexis S. Santos, and my work in graphic design is rooted in clarity, creativity, and intention. 
                    I’m driven by a deep passion for transforming ideas into impactful visuals that truly resonate. 
                    Every piece I create reflects my expertise, artistic vision, and commitment to producing strong, memorable designs. 
                    I take pride in crafting art that feels purposeful, inspiring, and made with genuine dedication.
